1	Kale & Ricotta Cannelloni  with Roasted Carrots	1 Prepare & roast the carrots: Remove the honey from the refrigerator to bring to room temperature. Preheat the oven to 450°F. Heat a large pot of salted water to boiling on high. Wash and dry the fresh produce. Peel the carrots; quarter lengthwise, then halve crosswise. Place on a sheet pan. Drizzle with olive oil and season with salt and pepper; toss to coat. Arrange in an even layer. Roast 17 to 19 minutes, or until tender when pierced with a fork. While the carrots roast, in a bowl, combine the honey (kneading the packet before opening) and half the vinegar. Remove the roasted carrots from the oven and top with the honey-vinegar mixture. Carefully toss to coat. Season with salt and pepper to taste. Set aside in a warm place.  Prepare the remaining ingredients: 2 Prepare the remaining ingredients: While the carrots continue to roast, remove and discard the stems of the kale; roughly chop the leaves. Peel the garlic; roughly chop 1 clove. Finely chop the remaining clove; using the side of your knife, smash until it resembles a paste (or use a zester). Halve the mozzarella cheese; small dice 1 half, keeping the other half whole. Place the tomatoes in a bowl; gently break apart with your hands. Roughly chop the almonds.  3 Cook the kale & make the filling: While the carrots continue to roast, add the chopped kale to the pot of boiling water. Cook, stirring occasionally, 5 to 7 minutes, or until tender. Leaving the pot of water boiling, using a slotted spoon or strainer, remove the cooked kale. Carefully pat dry with paper towels. Transfer to a large bowl; stir in the ricotta cheese, garlic paste, remaining vinegar, diced mozzarella cheese, and a drizzle of olive oil. Season with salt and pepper to taste.  Make the sauce: 4 Make the sauce: While the kale cooks, in a large pan (nonstick, if you have one), heat 2 teaspoons of olive oil on medium-high until hot. Add the chopped garlic; season with salt and pepper. Cook, stirring constantly, 30 seconds to 1 minute, or until fragrant. Add the tomatoes and as much of the red pepper flakes as you’d like, depending on how spicy you’d like the dish to be. Season with salt and pepper. Cook, stirring occasionally, 10 to 11 minutes, or until slightly thickened. Turn off the heat; season with salt and pepper to taste.  5 Cook the pasta & assemble the cannelloni: Separate the pasta sheets. Add to the same pot of boiling water; cook, stirring occasionally, 2 to 3 minutes, or until al dente (still slightly firm to the bite). Drain thoroughly; rinse under cold water for 30 seconds to 1 minute to stop the cooking process. Transfer to a work surface. Spread about half the sauce into the bottom of a baking dish. Divide the filling among the cooked pasta sheets. Roll the pasta sheets around the filling. Carefully transfer to the baking dish, seam side down. Top with the remaining sauce and remaining mozzarella cheese (tearing into small pieces before adding). Drizzle with olive oil; season with salt and pepper.  Bake the cannelloni & serve your dish: 6 Bake the cannelloni & serve your dish: Bake the cannelloni 14 to 16 minutes, or until the cheese is melted and lightly browned. Remove from the oven; let stand for 2 minutes. Garnish with the parmesan cheese. Top the roasted carrots with the chopped almonds. Enjoy!
2	Butternut Squash and Kale	Heat 1 tablespoon butter and olive oil in a large skillet over high heat. Add squash and sprinkle with salt, pepper, and chili powder. Cook for several minutes, turning gently with a spatula, until squash is deep golden brown and tender (but not falling apart.) Remove to a plate and set aside.  In the same skillet, melt 1 tablespoon of butter over medium-high heat and add in the kale. Toss it around with tongs and cook it for 3 to 4 minutes. Add in the cooked squash and gently toss together.  Serve as a side dish with chicken or beef, as a main veggie dish, or as a filling for quesadillas or sandwiches.
3	Crispy Potato Roast	1. Preheat oven to 375 degrees. In a small bowl, combine butter and oil. Brush bottom of a round 9-inch baking dish with some butter mixture. With a sharp knife or mandoline, slice potatoes very thinly crosswise.  2. Arrange potato slices vertically in dish. Wedge shallots throughout. Sprinkle with salt and red-pepper flakes (if using); brush with remaining butter mixture. Bake 1 1/4 hours. Add thyme and bake until potatoes are cooked through with a crisp top, about 35 minutes more.  Cook's Notes:  The thinner the potatoes are cut, the crispier they'll become in the oven. Keep the slices together as you cut them so that you can arrange them easily in the dish.
